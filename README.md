# Collaborative Filtering - Matrix Factorization

This repository contains the work done for the **Data Science Lab Project 1 (IASD)**, in collaboration with **Alexandre Olech** and **Matthieu Neau**, focusing on **Collaborative Filtering** techniques for recommendation systems. 

## ðŸ“œ Summary
This project focuses on **matrix factorization** as a key technique for **collaborative filtering**, complemented by **content-based approaches** to build a robust recommendation system.
- A custom implementation of **Unconstrained Matrix Factorization** in **PyTorch**.
- Experiments with initialization strategies, latent dimensions, and regularization coefficients.
- Integration of a **content-based model** using one-hot-encoded movie features and **gradient boosting**.
- Development of a **hybrid model** combining collaborative filtering and content-based methods for enhanced performance.
